### How To Uninstall Spicetify
1. Open Spicetify Installer
2. Click Uninstall if its already installed
3. Wait for it to uninstall
4. Click "OK" when finished uninstalling

If you can't click Uninstall button because it says Uninstalled then this means that Spicetify is not installed.
You can check to see if its installed at `%appdata%\spicetify` and `%localappdata%\spicetify` and if you see either one of these folders then please close Spicetify Installer and reopen it, and if you still see "Uninstalled" button then you can manually remove Spicetify by just deleting the folders at the location I gave earlier.
